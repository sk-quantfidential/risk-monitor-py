- [x] **Task 4**: Implement inter-service gRPC client communication ‚úÖ (GREEN phase)
- [x] **Task 5**: Refactor and optimize implementation ‚úÖ (REFACTOR phase)
- [x] **Task 6**: Validate BDD acceptance criteria and create completion documentation ‚úÖ (VALIDATION)

**FINAL IMPLEMENTATION INCLUDES**:
- ‚úÖ ConfigurationServiceClient with caching, validation, and performance monitoring
- ‚úÖ InterServiceClientManager with connection pooling and circuit breaker patterns
- ‚úÖ TradingEngineClient and TestCoordinatorClient with full gRPC capabilities
- ‚úÖ Service discovery integration for dynamic endpoint resolution
- ‚úÖ OpenTelemetry tracing and comprehensive observability
- ‚úÖ Production-ready error handling and resource management
- ‚úÖ Complete data models for all inter-service communication types
- ‚úÖ Performance statistics and monitoring APIs
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive validation script demonstrating all functionality

**BDD Acceptance**: Python services can discover and communicate with each other via gRPC

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.1b (Python Services Bootstrapping), TSE-0001.3a (Core Infrastructure)

**Technical Implementation Details**:
- **Configuration Service Client**: Create client to fetch configuration from central config service
- **Service Discovery Integration**: Use existing ServiceDiscovery to find configuration service endpoint
- **Inter-Service Communication**: Implement gRPC client calls to other Python services (trading-engine, test-coordinator)
- **Testing Strategy**: TDD with failing tests first, then implementation to make tests pass
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when services unavailable, retry mechanisms
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry tracing for all service-to-service calls

### üìä Milestone TSE-0001.4.4: Risk Monitor Data Adapter Integration
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (2025-10-03)
**Priority**: High
**Branch**: `refactor/epic-TSE-0001.4-data-adapters-and-orchestrator`

**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] Create risk-data-adapter-py component with repository pattern
- [x] Implement 6 repository interfaces (61 methods total)
- [x] Create 4 domain models with Pydantic v2 validation
- [x] PostgreSQL schema creation (risk schema with 4 tables)
- [x] Redis ACL user configuration (risk-adapter with risk:* namespace)
- [x] Factory pattern with graceful degradation
- [x] Stub implementations for all repositories
- [x] Comprehensive behavior tests (20/20 passing)
- [x] Integration with risk-monitor-py service layer
- [x] RiskMonitorService updated to use adapter repositories
- [x] Main.py adapter initialization and graceful shutdown
- [x] Integration test suite (8/8 passing)
- [x] Unit test validation (44/44 passing, no regressions)
- [x] Code quality improvements (datetime deprecation, Redis aclose)

**Deliverables**:
- ‚úÖ risk-data-adapter-py: 6 interfaces, 4 models, stub pattern, 20 tests
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL: risk schema (metrics, alerts, limits, position_snapshots)
- ‚úÖ Redis: risk-adapter ACL user with +ping permission
- ‚úÖ risk-monitor-py: Adapter integrated, 52 total tests passing
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation: Service works with or without adapter

**BDD Acceptance**: ‚úÖ Risk Monitor accesses databases only through public data-adapter interfaces, with graceful degradation when adapter unavailable

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.3c (Python Services gRPC Integration)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Milestone TSE-0001.7a: Risk Monitor Data Collection (PRIMARY)
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Production-like data integration

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Position tracking from exchange APIs
- [ ] Balance tracking from custodian APIs
- [ ] Real-time market data feed integration
- [ ] **Pure production design** - only accesses production APIs
- [ ] Data validation and error handling
- [ ] API client resilience patterns

**BDD Acceptance**: Risk Monitor can collect position and market data from all production APIs

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.3c (Python Services gRPC Integration), TSE-0001.4 (Market Data), TSE-0001.5b (Exchange), TSE-0001.6 (Custodian)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Milestone TSE-0001.7b: Risk Monitor Alert Generation (PRIMARY)
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Core risk monitoring functionality

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Basic P&L calculation from market data
- [ ] Simple threshold monitoring (position limits)
- [ ] Alert generation and notification system
- [ ] Prometheus metrics emission for compliance signals
- [ ] Risk compliance status tracking
- [ ] Alert timing and latency monitoring

**BDD Acceptance**: Risk Monitor detects position limit breaches and emits alerts

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.7a (Risk Monitor Data Collection)

### üìà Milestone TSE-0001.12a: Data Flow Integration
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: Medium

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Integration with complete trading flow validation
- [ ] Risk alert correlation with audit system
- [ ] End-to-end risk monitoring validation
- [ ] Production-like risk dashboard validation

**BDD Acceptance**: Market data flows correctly from simulator to risk monitor with acceptable latency

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.7b (Risk Monitor Alert Generation), TSE-0001.10 (Audit Infrastructure)

---

### üìà Milestone TSE-0001.12b: Trading Flow Integration
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: Medium

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Risk monitoring during trading validation
- [ ] Real-time position and P&L tracking during trades
- [ ] Alert generation during active trading scenarios

**BDD Acceptance**: Complete trading flow works end-to-end with risk monitoring

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.7b (Risk Monitor Alert Generation), TSE-0001.8 (Trading Engine), TSE-0001.6 (Custodian)

## Implementation Notes

- **Production Purity**: CRITICAL - Only access production APIs (exchange, custodian, market data)
- **No Audit Contamination**: Must NOT have access to simulation infrastructure
- **Signal Emission**: Risk compliance becomes another data stream for audit correlation
- **Alert Types**: Position limits, P&L drawdown, delta exposure, concentration risk
- **Performance**: Low-latency risk calculation and alert generation
- **Production Migration**: Must be deployable to production with zero changes
